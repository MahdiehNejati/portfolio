<p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mahdieh Nejati. I am currently a graduate student at Northwestern Univeristyâ€™s Master of Science in Robotics <a href="http://robotics.northwestern.edu/">(MSR)</a> program. I enjoy combining theory and creativity in order to develop new products and technologies that will benifit consumers on a global scale. </p>

<p>It was as a summer intern at the Biomimetics Laboratory in Auckland, New Zealand,that I was first exposed to biologically inspired design. This led me to commence a research project with the lab director, <a href="&quot;https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/iand002&quot;">Dr. Iain Anderson</a>, for my undergraduate thesis on the sensing of an underwater pneumatically actuated fin. The main focus and result of my project involved developing reliable, compliant, waterproof sensors capable of sensing the fluid flow around an immersed fin using Dielectric Elastomers inspired by the lateral line system in fish and proprioceptive nerve endings. My approach was a combination of theoretical and practical analysis, learning from and building upon iterations of prototypes, experimenting with different shapes, materials and designs. The researchers at the Biomimetics Laboratory were impressed with my practical and analytical skills and encouraged me to continue my research at the lab, where I became increasingly motivated to pursue a career in robotics. </p>

<p>Subsequently, I was fortunate enough to work with an extremely telented, energetic and enthusistic group of entrepreneurial engineers at <a href="http://www.stretchsense.com/">StretchSense Ltd</a>. During my fellowship I worked on the intigration of silicone sensing into conductive fabric (as seen on the front page of <a href="http://www.stretchsense.com/">www.stretchsense.com</a>). Looking to broaden my understanding of the world we live in, I traveled to nearly 15 countries before heading for a tour around the United States as part of the International Exchange Program (IEP) of North America.</p>

<p>Now in the Robotics graduate program at Northwestern, I am strengthening my skills in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence with coursework in machine learning/machine vision, artificial limbs (myoelectric control of upper limb prosthesis), control systems, dynamics, and robotic manipulation. This website is intended to showcase some of my experience with robotics in the MSR. Please visit my site as I continue to document my growing skills. </p>
