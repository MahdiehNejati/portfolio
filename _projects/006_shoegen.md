## Overview

This was some side project I did with Thomas McKay on Dielectric Elastomer Generator(s) (DEG). Tom's PhD research was on developing self priming DEG circuits that can generate enough power to be useful charging devices. Typically, DEGs need an external source of electricity to prime it. 

I was also mentioned by name in a press [release](http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/fuel-cells/squishy-power-generators) for this work.
