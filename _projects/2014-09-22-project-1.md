## Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a package for the KUKA youBot that enables the youBot to drive towards a predetermined object. The project required us to apply our knowledge of ROS (Robot Operating System) learned during the ["Embedded Systems in Robotics"](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/courses/descriptions/495-embedded-systems-in-robotics.html) course instructed by Dr. Schultz. This was the first time we used ROS to control a real robot.  It then aligns itself, picks the object up, and returns to the home position while holding the object. This package was developed in two parts. The two packages were then combined into the youbot_retrieve_msr package: 

1. Navigation of the robot base

  * youbot_nav_msr

2. Grasp control of the 5 degree of freedom arm

  *youbot_grasp_msr

You can watch a clip of the youBot working with our package [here](https://vimeo.com/114483339 "vimeo clip for youbot_retrieve_msr"). 

### Base Navigation
The ROS 2D navigation stack was used to control the robot base. 
The youbot_nav_msr package [source](https://github.com/jihoonkim92/youbot_nav_msr "youbot_nav_msr package") is available on github. 

### Manipulation
The youbot_grasp_msr package [source](https://github.com/mattmongeon/youbot_grasp_msr "youbot_grasp_msr package") is available on github. 

### Code
The code for this project was written in Python. 
The full package [source](https://github.com/MahdiehNejati/youbot_retrieve_msr "youbot_retrieve_msr package") is available on github.
