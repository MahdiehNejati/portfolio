## Overview
The power of control using optimal control theory is its ability to specify the control goal for both fully and under actuated systems, be it linear or nonlinear. What makes optimal contorl attractive is being able to analytically solve intractable control problems. This project considers a fully actuated double pendulum which can also be solved analytically. 

### Equations of Motion

The torque equations were derived using Lagrange's equations as follows:
