## Overview

The Dzhanibekove effect, aka the tennis racket theorem or intermediate axis theorem, describes the effect of rotating an object about its principle axes. Specifically, the rotation of an object about its first (or minimum) and third (or maximum) principal axes is stable, while rotation about its second principal axis (or intermediate axis) is not. 

I was very curious to use the theory from the ME 314 Intro to Dynamics class to model this effect. 

The final write up is linked [here](https://github.com/MahdiehNejati/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/public/documents/tennistheorem.pdf).
